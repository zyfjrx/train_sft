I need to solve the equation √(x² + 165) - √(x² - 52) = 7, and find all positive values of x. Hmm, radicals can be tricky, but maybe if I can eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides. Let me try that.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it right:\\n\\n√(x² + 165) - √(x² - 52) = 7.\\n\\nOkay, so the idea is to isolate one of the radicals and then square both sides. Let me try moving the second radical to the other side:\\n\\n√(x² + 165) = 7 + √(x² - 52).\\n\\nNow, if I square both sides, maybe I can get rid of the square roots. Let's do that:\\n\\n(√(x² + 165))² = (7 + √(x² - 52))².\\n\\nSimplifying the left side:\\n\\nx² + 165 = 49 + 14√(x² - 52) + (√(x² - 52))².\\n\\nThe right side is expanded using the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b². So the right side becomes 7² + 2*7*√(x² - 52) + (√(x² - 52))², which is 49 + 14√(x² - 52) + (x² - 52).\\n\\nSo putting it all together:\\n\\nx² + 165 = 49 + 14√(x² - 52) + x² - 52.\\n\\nHmm, let's simplify the right side. The x² terms will cancel out, right? Let's subtract x² from both sides:\\n\\n165 = 49 + 14√(x² - 52) - 52.\\n\\nSimplify the constants on the right:\\n\\n49 - 52 is -3, so:\\n\\n165 = -3 + 14√(x² - 52).\\n\\nNow, add 3 to both sides to isolate the radical term:\\n\\n165 + 3 = 14√(x² - 52).\\n\\nSo 168 = 14√(x² - 52).\\n\\nDivide both sides by 14:\\n\\n168 / 14 = √(x² - 52).\\n\\n12 = √(x² - 52).\\n\\nNow, square both sides again to eliminate the square root:\\n\\n12² = x² - 52.\\n\\n144 = x² - 52.\\n\\nAdd 52 to both sides:\\n\\n144 + 52 = x².\\n\\n196 = x².\\n\\nSo x = √196 = 14.\\n\\nBut wait, since the problem states that x is positive, we only take the positive root. So x = 14.\\n\\nBut hold on, when dealing with squaring equations, sometimes extraneous solutions can come up. I should check if this solution actually satisfies the original equation.\\n\\nLet's plug x = 14 back into the original equation:\\n\\n√(14² + 165) - √(14² - 52) = ?\\n\\nCalculate each term:\\n\\n14² is 196.\\n\\nSo first radical: √(196 + 165) = √361 = 19.\\n\\nSecond radical: √(196 - 52) = √144 = 12.\\n\\nSo 19 - 12 = 7, which is exactly the right-hand side. So yes, it checks out.\\n\\nTherefore, the only solution is x = 14. Since the problem says x is positive, we don't have to consider negative roots. So I think that's the answer.\\n</think>To solve the equation \\\\(\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52} = 7\\\\) for positive \\\\(x\\\\), we proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. Start with the given equation:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52} = 7\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. Isolate one of the square roots by moving \\\\(\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\\\) to the right side:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165} = 7 + \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. Square both sides to eliminate the square root on the left:\\n   \\\\[\\n   (\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165})^2 = (7 + \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52})^2\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying both sides, we get:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 + 165 = 49 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52} + (x^2 - 52)\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4. Combine like terms on the right side:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 + 165 = x^2 - 52 + 49 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying further:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 + 165 = x^2 - 3 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n5. Subtract \\\\(x^2\\\\) from both sides:\\n   \\\\[\\n   165 = -3 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n6. Add 3 to both sides to isolate the term with the square root:\\n   \\\\[\\n   168 = 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n7. Divide both sides by 14:\\n   \\\\[\\n   12 = \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n8. Square both sides again to eliminate the square root:\\n   \\\\[\\n   12^2 = x^2 - 52\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying:\\n   \\\\[\\n   144 = x^2 - 52\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n9.

Determine the nature of the series \\\\( \\\\sum \\\\frac{a_n^2}{1 + a_n^2} \\\\).', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': \"<think>\\nOkay, so I have this problem here where I need to determine the nature of the series ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) given that the series ∑a_n is convergent and each a_n is non-negative. Alright, let's start by understanding what the problem is asking. \\n\\nFirst, I know that ∑a_n is convergent, which means that the sequence a_n approaches zero as n approaches infinity. Because all the terms a_n are non-negative, they must be decreasing to zero, right? Wait, actually, convergence of the series only requires that the terms approach zero, but they don't necessarily have to be decreasing. For example, even if the terms bounce around a bit but still approach zero, the series can still converge if they do so quickly enough. But since the problem states a_n ≥ 0, we don't have to worry about negative terms messing up the convergence through cancellation.\\n\\nNow, the question is about the series ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²). We need to figure out if this series converges or diverges. Let me think about how the terms of this new series compare to the original series. Since each a_n is non-negative, a_n² is also non-negative, and dividing by 1 + a_n² will make each term of the new series non-negative as well. So, we're dealing with a series of non-negative terms, which is good because tests like the comparison test apply.\\n\\nLet me recall the comparison test: if 0 ≤ b_n ≤ c_n for all n, and ∑c_n converges, then ∑b_n converges. Conversely, if ∑b_n diverges, then ∑c_n diverges. So, if I can compare (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) to some other series that I know converges or diverges, that could help.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the limit comparison test. If I take the limit of [ (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ] / a_n as n approaches infinity, that might tell me something. Let's compute that limit.\\n\\nLimit as n → ∞ of [ (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ] / a_n = limit of [a_n² / (a_n(1 + a_n²))] = limit of [a_n / (1 + a_n²)].\\n\\nNow, since ∑a_n converges, we know that a_n must approach 0. So as n becomes large, a_n is approaching 0. Therefore, the denominator 1 + a_n² approaches 1. So the entire expression is approximately a_n / 1 = a_n. Therefore, the limit is 0. \\n\\nWait, but in the limit comparison test, if the limit is 0 and ∑a_n converges, then if the original series (the one with terms (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²)) is being compared to a convergent series, then what's the conclusion?\\n\\nHmm, let me recall: If the limit of b_n / c_n is 0, and ∑c_n converges, then ∑b_n converges. Because if b_n is eventually less than c_n, then the comparison test applies. So since (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) / a_n → 0, and ∑a_n converges, then by the limit comparison test, ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) also converges. \\n\\nWait, that seems straightforward, right? Because the limit is 0, which is finite, and the series we're comparing to (∑a_n) converges. Therefore, ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) must converge. \\n\\nBut let me verify this with another approach to make sure I'm not missing something. Let's think about the behavior of the terms (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²). Since a_n is non-negative and approaching 0, when n is large enough, a_n is less than or equal to 1, right? Because if a_n approaches 0, there exists some N such that for all n ≥ N, a_n ≤ 1. So for those n, a_n² ≤ a_n. Therefore, (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ a_n² ≤ a_n. \\n\\nTherefore, for n ≥ N, (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ a_n. Since ∑a_n converges, then by comparison test, ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) also converges. \\n\\nWait, that's a different argument. Let's see. So if a_n is less than or equal to 1, then a_n² is less than or equal to a_n, so (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ a_n² ≤ a_n. Therefore, since ∑a_n converges, the tail of the series ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) is dominated by ∑a_n, hence converges. Therefore, the entire series converges.\\n\\nAlternatively, even if a_n is sometimes greater than 1, but since the series ∑a_n converges, the terms a_n must approach zero, so beyond some N, they are all less than 1. So the initial terms where a_n might be greater than 1 can only contribute finitely many terms to the series, which doesn't affect convergence. Therefore, we can ignore those and focus on the tail where a_n < 1. Then, as above, in that region, (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ a_n² ≤ a_n, so again, since ∑a_n converges, so does ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²).\\n\\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to note that (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) is approximately a_n² when a_n is small. Since a_n approaches 0, a_n² is going to be much smaller than a_n. Therefore, if ∑a_n converges, then ∑a_n² might also converge, but actually, that's not necessarily always true. For example, take a_n = 1/n. Then ∑a_n diverges, but ∑a_n² converges. But in this problem, ∑a_n converges. So, for example, if a_n = 1/n², then ∑a_n converges (it's a p-series with p=2>1), and ∑a_n² would be ∑1/n^4, which also converges. But if a_n is 1/n^(1/2), but then ∑a_n would diverge. But in our problem, ∑a_n converges.\\n\\nWait, but the convergence of ∑a_n doesn't necessarily imply that a_n is summable with a higher exponent. For example, take a_n = 1/(n(log n)^2), which converges (by the integral test), then a_n² = 1/(n²(log n)^4), which would converge as well. But if a_n is like 1/n^(1/2 + ε) for some ε>0, then ∑a_n converges if 1/2 + ε > 1, i.e., ε > 1/2. Then a_n² would be 1/n^(1 + 2ε), which converges as well. So in these cases, if a_n is eventually small enough such that ∑a_n converges, then a_n² is even smaller, so ∑a_n² converges. However, perhaps there is a case where ∑a_n converges but ∑a_n² diverges? Hmm. Wait, no. If a_n is non-negative and ∑a_n converges, then a_n must approach zero, and for sufficiently large n, a_n ≤1. Therefore, a_n² ≤ a_n for those n, hence ∑a_n² converges by comparison to ∑a_n. Wait, that's true, isn't it? If a_n is eventually less than or equal to 1, then a_n² ≤ a_n, so ∑a_n² converges. Therefore, in our problem, the series ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) is dominated by ∑a_n², which is dominated by ∑a_n. So, if we can bound (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ a_n², and ∑a_n² converges, then ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) would converge as well.\\n\\nBut actually, (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ a_n², right? Because 1 + a_n² ≥1, so dividing by something bigger than 1 makes the fraction smaller. So (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ a_n². And since ∑a_n² converges, as I thought before, then by comparison, ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) also converges.\\n\\nWait, but I had earlier compared (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) directly to a_n and used the limit comparison test. So both approaches seem valid. Let me just check with an example. Suppose a_n = 1/n². Then ∑a_n converges. Then (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) = (1/n^4)/(1 + 1/n²) = 1/(n^4 + n²) ≈ 1/n^4 for large n, so the series ∑1/(n^4 + n²) converges. Another example: a_n = 1/n. But wait, ∑a_n diverges here, which doesn't fit the problem's condition. So if a_n is 1/n^p with p>1, then ∑a_n converges, and ∑a_n² converges as well. \\n\\nAlternatively, take a_n = 1/(n^(1/2 + ε)), with ε > 1/2 so that ∑a_n converges. Then a_n² = 1/n^{1 + 2ε}, and since 1 + 2ε > 1, ∑a_n² converges. \\n\\nBut actually, the key point here is that since a_n tends to 0, for sufficiently large n, a_n ≤1, so a_n² ≤ a_n, so ∑a_n² is dominated by ∑a_n. Therefore, ∑a_n² converges, and since (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ a_n², then ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) converges as well. Therefore, the series in question converges.\\n\\nWait, but maybe I should be careful here. Let me think again. If a_n is 0, then the term is 0. If a_n is very large, say approaching infinity, but wait, in our case, a_n approaches 0, so that's not possible. But in the problem, the series ∑a_n is convergent, so the terms a_n must approach zero. Therefore, beyond some N, a_n ≤1, so the denominator 1 + a_n² ≥1, hence (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤a_n². Therefore, for all n beyond N, the terms are bounded above by a_n², which is summable because a_n² ≤ a_n for n ≥N (since a_n ≤1). Therefore, ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) converges by comparison to ∑a_n.\\n\\nAlternatively, to put it more formally:\\n\\nSince ∑a_n converges, a_n →0. Therefore, there exists N such that for all n ≥N, a_n ≤1. For those n, a_n² ≤a_n. Therefore, (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤a_n² ≤a_n. Hence, ∑_{n=N}^∞ (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ ∑_{n=N}^∞ a_n < ∞. Therefore, the tail converges, and adding the first N-1 terms (which are finite) doesn't affect convergence. Therefore, the entire series ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) converges.\\n\\nAlternatively, another approach: note that (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ min(a_n², 1). But since a_n →0, eventually min(a_n², 1) = a_n², so again, ∑a_n² converges. So this gives another way to see it.\\n\\nWait, but in all these approaches, the conclusion is the same: the series ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) converges. Therefore, the answer should be that the series converges.\\n\\nBut wait, let me check with a concrete example where a_n is sometimes large. Suppose a_n is 1 for some n. Then (1^2)/(1 +1^2)=1/2. But since ∑a_n converges, a_n must approach 0, so only finitely many terms can be ≥1. So those terms contribute a finite sum, and the rest of the terms where a_n <1 can be compared to a_n² or a_n. Therefore, even if there are a few terms where a_n is large, they don't affect the convergence of the series.\\n\\nFor example, take a_n = 2 for n=1, and a_n =1/n² for n≥2. Then ∑a_n =2 + ∑1/n², which converges. Then ∑(a_n²)/(1 +a_n²) = (4/5) + ∑_{n=2}^∞ [ (1/n^4)/(1 +1/n²) ] = 4/5 + ∑_{n=2}^\\\\infty [1/(n^4 +n²)]. Since the tail is convergent, the entire series converges.\\n\\nAnother test case: a_n =1 for n=1, and a_n=0 for n≥2. Then ∑a_n converges (sum is 1), and ∑(a_n²)/(1 +a_n²)=1/2 + 0, which is obviously convergent.\\n\\nSo, all these test cases support the conclusion that ∑(a_n²)/(1 +a_n²) converges.\\n\\nBut let me think if there could be any counterexample. Suppose ∑a_n converges, but ∑(a_n²)/(1 +a_n²) diverges. Is that possible?\\n\\nIf ∑a_n converges, then a_n →0. So for sufficiently large n, a_n is small. Therefore, (a_n²)/(1 +a_n²) ≈ a_n². Therefore, if ∑a_n² diverges, then ∑(a_n²)/(1 +a_n²) would also diverge. But can ∑a_n converge while ∑a_n² diverges?\\n\\nWait, but earlier, we thought that if a_n ≤1 for sufficiently large n, then a_n² ≤ a_n, so ∑a_n² converges by comparison. Therefore, if ∑a_n converges, then ∑a_n² must converge as well. Therefore, ∑(a_n²)/(1 +a_n²) is dominated by ∑a_n², which converges, hence itself converges. Therefore, such a counterexample isn't possible. Therefore, the conclusion is that ∑(a_n²)/(1 +a_n²) must converge.\\n\\nSo, after all this thinking and checking with different examples and approaches, I believe the answer is that the series ∑(a_n²)/(1 +a_n²) converges.\\n</think>To determine the nature of the series \\\\( \\\\sum \\\\frac{a_n^2}{1 + a_n^2} \\\\) given that \\\\( \\\\sum a_n \\\\) is a convergent series with \\\\( a_n \\\\geq 0 \\\\), we proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. **Convergence of \\\\( \\\\sum a_n \\\\)**:\\n   Since \\\\( \\\\sum a_n \\\\) converges, it follows that \\\\( a_n \\\\to 0 \\\\) as \\\\( n \\\\to \\\\infty \\\\).\\n\\n2. **Behavior of \\\\( \\\\frac{a_n^2}{1 + a_n^2} \\\\)**:\\n   For sufficiently large \\\\( n \\\\), \\\\( a_n \\\\) is small.

Hmm, let me think. First, since the integral is from 0 to infinity and the denominator is x squared plus a squared, maybe a substitution involving trigonometric functions? Wait, or perhaps substitution for the logarithm part. Let me consider substitution variables. Let’s see, maybe let t = x/a? That could simplify the denominator. If I set t = x/a, then x = a t, and dx = a dt. Let me try that substitution.\\n\\nSo when x is 0, t is 0, and as x approaches infinity, t approaches infinity. Then the integral becomes:\\n\\n∫₀^∞ [ln(a t)] / ( (a t)² + a² ) * a dt.\\n\\nSimplify the denominator: a² t² + a² = a²(t² + 1). So the integral becomes (a/(a²)) ∫₀^∞ [ln(a) + ln(t)] / (t² + 1) dt. That simplifies to (1/a) [ ln(a) ∫₀^∞ 1/(t² +1) dt + ∫₀^∞ ln(t)/(t² +1) dt ].\\n\\nWait, the first integral ∫1/(t² +1) dt from 0 to ∞ is [arctan t] from 0 to ∞, which is π/2. So that term would be (1/a) * ln(a) * π/2. Then the second integral is (1/a) times ∫₀^∞ ln(t)/(t² +1) dt. Hmm, I need to figure out what that integral is.\\n\\nI recall that ∫₀^∞ ln(t)/(t² +1) dt might be zero because of symmetry. Let me check that. If I make a substitution u = 1/t, then t = 1/u, dt = -1/u² du. Let's see:\\n\\nWhen t approaches 0+, u approaches infinity, and when t approaches infinity, u approaches 0+. So the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ ln(t)/(t² +1) dt = ∫_{∞}^0 ln(1/u)/( (1/u²) +1 ) * (-1/u²) du. Let me simplify this.\\n\\nFirst, ln(1/u) is -ln u. The denominator becomes (1 + u²)/u². So the integral becomes ∫_{0}^∞ [ -ln u ] / ( (1 + u²)/u² ) * (1/u²) du. Simplify: multiply numerator and denominator: [-ln u * u² / (1 + u²)] * (1/u²) du = -ln u / (1 + u²) du. So we have:\\n\\n∫₀^∞ ln(t)/(t² +1) dt = ∫₀^∞ -ln u/(1 + u²) du. Let’s denote the original integral as I. Then I = -I, which implies that 2I = 0, so I = 0. Therefore, the second integral is zero. That's interesting!\\n\\nSo going back, the entire original integral is (1/a) * (ln(a) * π/2 + 0) = (π ln a)/(2a). Wait, but let me verify if that's correct. I think I saw somewhere that ∫₀^∞ ln x/(x² + a²) dx equals (π ln a)/(2a). But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the substitution.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there's another method. Let me try differentiation under the integral sign. Let’s consider the integral F(a) = ∫₀^∞ ln x/(x² + a²) dx. Maybe differentiate F(a) with respect to a? Let's compute F'(a).\\n\\nBut first, let's see if we can express F(a) in terms that can be differentiated. Let me make a substitution similar to before. Let t = x/a, so x = a t, dx = a dt. Then, as before, F(a) = ∫₀^∞ [ln(a t)] / (a² t² + a²) * a dt = (1/a) ∫₀^∞ [ln a + ln t]/(t² +1) dt. Which again gives the same result as before, (π ln a)/(2a) + (1/a) * 0 = π ln a/(2a). So if that substitution is correct, then that's the answer.\\n\\nBut maybe to check, let's compute the integral another way. Let's use contour integration in complex analysis, but since I'm not very sure about that, maybe a different substitution.\\n\\nWait, another approach: Let me consider x = a tan θ. Then, when x = 0, θ = 0, and x → ∞, θ → π/2. Then dx = a sec²θ dθ. Substitute into the integral:\\n\\n∫₀^{π/2} [ln(a tan θ)] / (a² tan² θ + a²) * a sec²θ dθ. Simplify denominator: a²(tan² θ +1 ) = a² sec² θ. So the integral becomes ∫ [ln(a) + ln(tan θ)] / (a² sec² θ) * a sec² θ dθ. Simplify: (a / a²) ∫₀^{π/2} [ln a + ln(tan θ)] dθ = (1/a) [ ln a ∫₀^{π/2} dθ + ∫₀^{π/2} ln(tan θ) dθ ].\\n\\nAgain, the first integral is (ln a)(π/2). The second integral ∫ ln(tan θ) dθ from 0 to π/2. Let’s see if that’s zero. Let’s substitute φ = π/2 - θ. Then when θ = 0, φ = π/2; θ = π/2, φ = 0. The integral becomes ∫_{π/2}^0 ln(tan(π/2 - φ)) (-dφ) = ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot φ) dφ = ∫₀^{π/2} -ln(tan φ) dφ. So that integral becomes -∫₀^{π/2} ln(tan φ) dφ. If we denote the original integral as J, then J = -J, so 2J = 0, so J=0. Therefore, the integral of ln(tan θ) from 0 to π/2 is zero. So the entire integral becomes (1/a) * (π/2 ln a + 0 ) = π ln a/(2a). So that's the same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe use differentiation under integral sign. Let’s consider a parameter b, set F(b) = ∫₀^∞ x^{b}/(x² + a²) dx. Then, differentiate F(b) with respect to b and set b=0 to get the integral involving ln x. Wait, let's check.\\n\\nSo F(b) = ∫₀^∞ x^b/(x² + a²) dx. Let me compute this integral first. Let substitution x = a t, so x^b = a^b t^b, dx = a dt. Then F(b) = ∫₀^∞ (a^b t^b)/(a² t² + a²) a dt = a^{b +1}/a² ∫₀^∞ t^b/(t² +1) dt = a^{b -1} ∫₀^∞ t^b/(t² +1) dt.\\n\\nNow, the integral ∫₀^∞ t^b/(t² +1) dt can be related to the Beta function. Let’s set u = t², so t = u^{1/2}, dt = (1/2) u^{-1/2} du. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ (u^{b/2})/(u +1) * (1/2) u^{-1/2} du = (1/2) ∫₀^∞ u^{(b -1)/2}/(1 + u) du. This is (1/2) B( (b +1)/2, 1 - (b +1)/2 ) = (1/2) * π / sin( π ( (b +1)/2 ) ) by the Beta function relation to Gamma functions. Wait, Beta function is Γ(p)Γ(q)/Γ(p + q), and Γ(p)Γ(1 - p) = π / sin(π p).\\n\\nSo here, p = (b +1)/2, and 1 - p = (1 - b)/2. So Beta(p, 1 - p) = π / sin( π p ). So the integral ∫₀^∞ t^b/(t² +1) dt = (1/2) * π / sin( π ( (b +1)/2 ) ). Therefore, F(b) = a^{b -1} * π/(2 sin( π (b +1)/2 )).\\n\\nThen, the original integral is F'(0), since the integral with ln x is the derivative at b=0. Let’s compute F'(b):\\n\\nF(b) = (π/2) a^{b -1} / sin( π (b +1)/2 )\\n\\nTake natural log of F(b): ln F(b) = ln(π/2) + (b -1) ln a - ln sin( π (b +1)/2 )\\n\\nDifferentiate both sides:\\n\\nF’(b)/F(b) = ln a - [ π/2 * cos( π (b +1)/2 ) / sin( π (b +1)/2 ) ]\\n\\nSo F’(b) = F(b) [ ln a - (π/2) cot( π (b +1)/2 ) ]\\n\\nNow evaluate at b=0. First, F(0) = (π/2) a^{-1} / sin( π (1)/2 ) = (π/(2a)) / 1 = π/(2a). Then, cot( π (0 +1)/2 ) = cot(π/2) = 0. Because cot(π/2) is cos(π/2)/sin(π/2) = 0/1 = 0. Therefore,\\n\\nF’(0) = (π/(2a)) [ ln a - (π/2)*0 ] = (π/(2a)) ln a. So the integral is (π ln a)/(2a). \\n\\nThis matches the previous results, so it seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be π times ln a divided by (2a), which in box form is \\\\boxed{\\\\dfrac{\\\\pi \\\\ln a}{2a}}.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{\\\\dfrac{\\\\pi \\\\ln a}{2a}}\\n</think>To solve the integral \\\\(\\\\int_0^{+\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\ln x}{x^2 + a^2} \\\\, \\\\text{d}x\\\\) for \\\\(a > 0\\\\), we start by making a substitution to simplify the expression.\\n\\nLet \\\\( t = \\\\frac{x}{a} \\\\).

Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with limits involving factorials and roots, there are some techniques like using Stirling's approximation. But I'm not sure if I should use that here or if there's another way.\\n\\nWait, Stirling's formula approximates n! for large n, right? It says that n! is approximately n^n e^{-n} √(2πn). If I use that, then maybe I can substitute that into the expression. Let me try that.\\n\\nSo, substituting Stirling's approximation into ⁿ√(n!), we get the nth root of [n^n e^{-n} √(2πn)]. Breaking that down, the nth root of n^n is just n, because (n^n)^(1/n) = n. Then the nth root of e^{-n} would be e^{-1}, since (e^{-n})^(1/n) = e^{-1}. Now, the nth root of √(2πn) is (2πn)^(1/(2n)). \\n\\nPutting that all together, the expression becomes n * e^{-1} * (2πn)^(1/(2n)). Now, I need to take the limit as n approaches infinity of this expression. Let's analyze each part.\\n\\nFirst, the term n/e. As n goes to infinity, n/e clearly goes to infinity. Wait, but that can't be right because if n! grows faster than exponential, but taking the nth root... Maybe my approach is wrong here. Because if n/e goes to infinity, then the limit would be infinity, but I have another term here: (2πn)^(1/(2n)).\\n\\nLet me check that again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake with Stirling's formula. Let me recall: Stirling's formula is n! ≈ (n/e)^n √(2πn). So the approximation is n! ≈ (n^n e^{-n}) √(2πn). So when I take the nth root of n!, it's [(n^n e^{-n}) √(2πn)]^(1/n) = (n^n)^(1/n) * (e^{-n})^(1/n) * (√(2πn))^(1/n).\\n\\nSimplifying each term:\\n\\n(n^n)^(1/n) = n.\\n\\n(e^{-n})^(1/n) = e^{-1}.\\n\\n(√(2πn))^(1/n) = (2πn)^(1/(2n)).\\n\\nNow, combining those: n * e^{-1} * (2πn)^(1/(2n)).\\n\\nSo we have the limit as n approaches infinity of [n / e] * (2πn)^{1/(2n)}.\\n\\nNow, I need to evaluate the limit of this expression. Let's analyze each part. The term (2πn)^{1/(2n)}. Let me take the natural logarithm to simplify the limit. Let's let L = lim_{n→∞} [n / e] * (2πn)^{1/(2n)}.\\n\\nTake the natural logarithm of L:\\n\\nln L = lim_{n→∞} [ln(n) - 1 + (1/(2n)) ln(2πn)].\\n\\nSimplify the third term: (1/(2n)) ln(2πn) = [ln(2π) + ln n]/(2n) = (ln(2π))/(2n) + (ln n)/(2n).\\n\\nAs n approaches infinity, (ln(2π))/(2n) tends to 0, and (ln n)/(2n) also tends to 0 because ln n grows much slower than n. So the entire third term goes to 0.\\n\\nTherefore, ln L = lim_{n→∞} [ln(n) - 1 + 0] = lim_{n→∞} (ln n - 1). But ln n approaches infinity as n approaches infinity. So ln L is infinity, which means that L is e^{infinity} which is infinity. But that contradicts what I know, because I think the limit of the nth root of n! should be infinity, but maybe not? Wait, let me think again.\\n\\nWait, actually, n! grows faster than exponential functions, but when taking the nth root, perhaps the growth rate is tempered. Wait, but for example, the nth root of n! is (n!)^{1/n}, and I think this limit is actually infinity. Wait, no, I might be confused here.\\n\\nWait, let me check with some specific values. Let's compute for n=2: sqrt(2!) = sqrt(2) ≈1.414. For n=3: cube root of 6 ≈ 1.817. For n=4: 4th root of 24 ≈ 2.213. For n=5: 5th root of 120 ≈ 2.605. So as n increases, it's increasing. So maybe the limit is indeed infinity. But I remember that there's a result saying that lim_{n→∞} (n!)^{1/n} = infinity. Wait, but maybe I'm wrong. Wait, I'm confused because sometimes in similar limits, like lim_{n→∞} (n)^{1/n} = 1, but here it's different.\\n\\nWait, let me check another approach. Let's use the property that for a sequence a_n, if the limit of a_{n+1}/a_n exists, then the limit of a_n^{1/n} is the same. So maybe using the ratio test idea. Let me apply that.\\n\\nLet a_n = n!. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = (n+1)! / n! = n+1. Then the limit as n approaches infinity of a_{n+1}/a_n is infinity. Therefore, the limit of a_n^{1/n} should also be infinity. Wait, that's a different approach and it seems to confirm that the limit is infinity. Hmm, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here.\\n\\nWait, wait, actually, the root test says that if lim sup |a_n|^{1/n} = L, then the radius of convergence is 1/L. But in our case, we're not dealing with a series, but the limit of (n!)^{1/n}. But according to the root test, if you have a series sum a_n, then the radius of convergence is 1/L where L is the lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}. For the series sum n! x^n, the radius of convergence is 0 because lim (n!)^{1/n} = infinity, so 1/L = 0. That seems to confirm that (n!)^{1/n} tends to infinity. Therefore, the limit is infinity.\\n\\nBut earlier, using Stirling's approximation gave me that the expression is n/e times something approaching 1, so the limit would be infinity, which aligns with the root test result. So maybe the answer is indeed infinity. But I'm confused because some sources might say that lim (n!)^{1/n} = infinity, which is correct. Wait, yes, because n! grows faster than any exponential function, so taking the nth root would still leave it growing. For example, compare to an exponential function like a^n. Then (a^n)^{1/n} = a. But n! grows faster than a^n for any fixed a, so (n!)^{1/n} should grow without bound. Therefore, the limit is infinity. So maybe the answer is infinity.\\n\\nWait, but let me check again with Stirling's formula. If n! ≈ (n/e)^n sqrt(2πn), then (n!)^{1/n} ≈ (n/e) * (2πn)^{1/(2n)}. Now, (2πn)^{1/(2n)} is equal to e^{(ln(2πn))/(2n)}. As n approaches infinity, ln(2πn)/(2n) tends to 0, so the exponential term tends to e^0 = 1. Therefore, the approximation becomes (n!)^{1/n} ≈ n/e * 1 = n/e. Therefore, as n approaches infinity, this tends to infinity. So yes, the limit is infinity.\\n\\nWait, so then the answer should be infinity. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here because sometimes people consider that the nth root of n factorial is e, but that's incorrect. Let me check. If the limit were e, then as n increases, (n!)^{1/n} would approach e. But in reality, when n=5, we have (120)^{1/5} ≈ 2.6, which is already higher than e (approx 2.718), but wait, 2.6 is less than e. Wait, e is approximately 2.718, so 2.6 is less. Wait, but when n=10: 10! = 3628800. 3628800^(1/10) is approximately (3.6288 x 10^6)^(1/10). Let's calculate: 10^6^(1/10) = 10^(6/10) = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98. Multiply by 3.6288^(0.1): 3.6288^0.1 ≈ 1.15. So approximately 3.98 * 1.15 ≈ 4.577. Which is higher than e. So as n increases, it's increasing beyond e. Then, if n=100, (100!)^{1/100} would be even larger, so the limit is indeed infinity.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is infinity, which would be represented as \\\\boxed{\\\\infty}. But I should confirm once more. Let me recall that in some references, the limit is indeed infinity. For example, in mathematical analysis, it's known that n! grows faster than exponential functions, and thus its nth root also tends to infinity.

Hmm, let's see. Let me start by understanding the problem. The expression 3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1} should divide 3^n + 5^n. So for a given n, when we divide 3^n + 5^n by 3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1}, the result should be an integer. \\n\\nFirst, maybe I can rewrite 3^n as 3 * 3^{n-1} and 5^n as 5 * 5^{n-1}. That might help me factor or simplify the expression. Let's try that:\\n\\n3^n + 5^n = 3*3^{n-1} + 5*5^{n-1}\\n\\nSo the divisor is 3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1}. Let's denote A = 3^{n-1} and B = 5^{n-1}, so the problem becomes: when does A + B divide 3A + 5B?\\n\\nSo, we want (3A + 5B)/(A + B) to be an integer. Let me compute this fraction:\\n\\n(3A + 5B)/(A + B) = [3A + 5B] / [A + B]\\n\\nLet me try to perform the division. Maybe express it as a combination:\\n\\nLet me see, 3A + 5B = 3(A + B) + 2B. So:\\n\\n[3(A + B) + 2B]/(A + B) = 3 + (2B)/(A + B)\\n\\nSo the expression simplifies to 3 + (2B)/(A + B). Therefore, for the entire expression to be an integer, (2B)/(A + B) must be an integer. Since 3 is already an integer, adding 3 to another integer will keep it integer. Therefore, the condition reduces to (2B)/(A + B) being an integer.\\n\\nSubstituting back A and B, we get:\\n\\n(2*5^{n-1}) / (3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1}) must be an integer. Let's denote this fraction as K, where K is a positive integer. So,\\n\\n2*5^{n-1} = K*(3^{n-1} + 5^{n-1})\\n\\nLet me rearrange the terms:\\n\\n2*5^{n-1} = K*3^{n-1} + K*5^{n-1}\\n\\nBring all terms to one side:\\n\\n2*5^{n-1} - K*5^{n-1} - K*3^{n-1} = 0\\n\\nFactor out 5^{n-1}:\\n\\n(2 - K)*5^{n-1} - K*3^{n-1} = 0\\n\\nSo,\\n\\n(2 - K)*5^{n-1} = K*3^{n-1}\\n\\nWhich can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(5/3)^{n-1} = K/(2 - K)\\n\\nSince the left-hand side is (5/3)^{n-1}, which is positive for all n, the right-hand side must also be positive. Therefore, K/(2 - K) > 0. For this fraction to be positive, either both numerator and denominator are positive or both are negative. \\n\\nCase 1: K > 0 and 2 - K > 0. So K > 0 and K < 2. Since K is a positive integer, K must be 1.\\n\\nCase 2: K < 0 and 2 - K < 0. But K is a positive integer, so this case is impossible. So only K = 1 is possible.\\n\\nTherefore, substituting K = 1 into the equation:\\n\\n(5/3)^{n-1} = 1/(2 - 1) = 1\\n\\nSo (5/3)^{n-1} = 1. Taking logarithms on both sides:\\n\\n(n - 1) * ln(5/3) = 0\\n\\nSince ln(5/3) is not zero, this implies n - 1 = 0 => n = 1.\\n\\nWait, but let me check that. If n = 1, let's test the original equation:\\n\\n3^{0} + 5^{0} = 1 + 1 = 2\\n\\n3^{1} + 5^{1} = 3 + 5 = 8\\n\\nThen 2 divides 8? Yes, since 8 / 2 = 4, which is an integer. So n = 1 is a solution.\\n\\nBut is that the only solution? Wait, maybe I should check for other possible values of K, but according to our earlier reasoning, only K = 1 is possible because K has to be a positive integer less than 2, so K=1.\\n\\nBut let me check if there could be other K values if the right-hand side isn't positive? Wait, we considered that. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake here.\\n\\nWait, let me think again. Suppose K is a positive integer. Then for K/(2 - K) to be positive, both numerator and denominator must be positive, which requires K < 2, so K=1, or denominator and numerator both negative, which would require K > 2 but denominator 2 - K negative. But since K is positive, denominator is negative when K > 2, so then numerator would have to be negative as well. But numerator K is positive, so that's impossible. Therefore, only K=1 is possible.\\n\\nBut maybe there's a mistake here. Let me test for n=2:\\n\\nCheck n=2. Then 3^{1} + 5^{1} = 3 + 5 = 8, and 3^{2} + 5^{2} = 9 + 25 = 34. Does 8 divide 34? 34 divided by 8 is 4.25, which is not an integer. So n=2 doesn't work.\\n\\nn=3: 3^{2} +5^{2}=9+25=34. 3^3 +5^3=27+125=152. 34 divides 152? 152/34=4.4705... which is not integer. So no.\\n\\nWait, but according to our previous conclusion, only n=1 works. But maybe there's another value. Let me check n=0. Wait, n must be positive integers, so n=0 is not allowed.\\n\\nWait, let me check n=1 again. 3^{0} +5^{0}=2 divides 3^1 +5^1=8. 8 divided by 2 is 4. Correct.\\n\\nBut what about n=4? Let's compute 3^{3} +5^{3}=27+125=152. Then 3^4 +5^4=81 + 625=706. 152 divides 706? 706 divided by 152 is about 4.64, not integer.\\n\\nn=5: 3^4 +5^4=81+625=706. 3^5 +5^5=243 +3125=3368. 706 divides 3368? Let's divide 3368 by 706. 706*4=2824. 3368-2824=544. 544 is less than 706, so no.\\n\\nHmm, seems like only n=1 works. But let me see if there's a higher n where this might hold. Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let's consider writing 3^n +5^n divided by 3^{n-1} +5^{n-1}.\\n\\nExpress it as:\\n\\n(3^n +5^n)/(3^{n-1} +5^{n-1}) = (3*3^{n-1} +5*5^{n-1})/(3^{n-1} +5^{n-1}) = [3A +5B]/[A + B], where A=3^{n-1}, B=5^{n-1}\\n\\nThen, as before, this is 3 + (2B)/(A + B). So (2*5^{n-1})/(3^{n-1} +5^{n-1}) must be integer. Let's denote x = 5^{n-1}, y = 3^{n-1}, so the fraction becomes 2x/(x + y). For this to be integer, (x + y) must divide 2x. So x + y | 2x. Which implies x + y divides 2x. Therefore, x + y divides 2x. But x + y divides 2x if and only if x + y divides 2x mod (x + y). Wait, perhaps another way: since x + y divides 2x, then x + y divides 2x - k*(x + y) for any integer k. Let me pick k=1: 2x - (x + y) = x - y. So x + y divides x - y. Similarly, x + y divides x - y. Which would imply that x + y divides (x - y) + (x + y) = 2x. Which loops back. Maybe another approach.\\n\\nAlternatively, x + y divides 2x implies that (x + y) divides 2x. Since x and y are coprime? Wait, 3 and 5 are coprime, so 3^{n-1} and 5^{n-1} are coprime. Therefore, x and y are coprime. Therefore, x + y and x are coprime? Not necessarily. Let's see: GCD(x + y, x) = GCD(y, x) = 1, since x and y are coprime. So GCD(x + y, x) = 1, similarly GCD(x + y, y) = GCD(x, y) =1. Therefore, x + y divides 2, since x + y divides 2x and GCD(x + y, x)=1, so x + y divides 2. Similarly, x + y divides 2.\\n\\nTherefore, x + y is a divisor of 2. But x = 5^{n-1} and y=3^{n-1}, both are positive integers, so x + y >= 5^{0} + 3^{0} = 2. So the possible divisors of 2 are 1 and 2. But x + y >=2, so x + y=2.\\n\\nThus, 3^{n-1} +5^{n-1}=2. Since 3^{n-1} and5^{n-1} are both positive integers. Let's find n such that 3^{n-1} +5^{n-1}=2.\\n\\nPossible when n-1=0, since 3^0 +5^0=1+1=2. So n-1=0 => n=1. For n>1, 3^{n-1} +5^{n-1} >=3 +5=8, which is already greater than 2. Therefore, the only solution is n=1.\\n\\nTherefore, the only positive integer n is 1.\\n\\nWait, that seems consistent with earlier results. So maybe this is the only solution. So the answer is \\\\boxed{1}\\n\\nBut let me just verify once again. If n=1, then 3^{0} +5^{0}=2 divides 3^1 +5^1=8. 8 divided by 2 is 4. Correct. For n=2, the divisor is 8, as before, and the dividend is 34, which is not divisible by 8. For n=3, divisor is 34, dividend is 152, which is not divisible by 34. For n=4, divisor is 152, dividend is 706, which is not divisible. So yeah, seems like n=1 is the only solution.\\n\\nAnother approach: Let me suppose that n >1. Then 5^{n-1} >3^{n-1}, so 3^{n-1} +5^{n-1} is dominated by 5^{n-1}. Similarly, 3^n +5^n =3*3^{n-1} +5*5^{n-1}. Let me write the ratio:\\n\\n(3*3^{n-1} +5*5^{n-1})/(3^{n-1} +5^{n-1}) = (3*(3/5)^{n-1} +5)/( (3/5)^{n-1} +1 )\\n\\nLet me denote t = (3/5)^{n-1}. Since n >=1, and 3/5 <1, as n increases, t decreases towards 0. So the expression becomes (3t +5)/(t +1). Let's compute this:\\n\\n(3t +5)/(t +1) = (5 +3t)/(1 +t). Let me perform division:\\n\\n(5 +3t) divided by (1 +t). Let's write 5 +3t =3(1 +t) +2. So:\\n\\n= 3 + 2/(1 +t)\\n\\nTherefore, the ratio is 3 + 2/(1 + t). Since t = (3/5)^{n-1}, which is a positive real number less than or equal to 1 (for n >=1, n=1 gives t=1, n=2 gives t=3/5, etc.)\\n\\nSo 1 + t >=1 +0=1. Therefore, 2/(1 + t) <=2. Therefore, the expression 3 + 2/(1 + t) is between 3 and 5. For the entire expression to be integer, the fractional part 2/(1 + t) must be an integer. So 2/(1 + t) must be integer. Let me call this k, an integer. So 2/(1 +t)=k, which implies 1 + t=2/k. Therefore, t=2/k -1. But t is positive, so 2/k -1 >0 =>2/k >1 =>k <2. Since k is a positive integer (because 2/(1 + t) must be positive integer), possible k=1. Then:\\n\\nk=1: 1 + t=2/1=2 =>t=1. But t=(3/5)^{n-1}=1. So (3/5)^{n-1}=1 implies n-1=0 =>n=1. So only solution. If k=0, but k must be positive integer, so k=1 is the only possibility.\\n\\nTherefore, again, n=1 is the only solution.\\n\\nAnother way: Maybe assume that for n ≥2, 3^{n-1} +5^{n-1} divides 3^n +5^n. Let's denote d_n =3^{n-1} +5^{n-1}. Then we have d_n divides 3^n +5^n =3*3^{n-1} +5*5^{n-1}=3*(d_n -5^{n-1}) +5*5^{n-1}=3d_n -3*5^{n-1} +5*5^{n-1}=3d_n +2*5^{n-1}\\n\\nSo 3^n +5^n =3d_n +2*5^{n-1}. Therefore, d_n divides 3d_n +2*5^{n-1}, which implies d_n divides 2*5^{n-1}. Therefore, d_n |2*5^{n-1}.\\n\\nBut d_n=3^{n-1} +5^{n-1}. So 3^{n-1} +5^{n-1} divides 2*5^{n-1}.\\n\\nTherefore, since 3^{n-1} and5^{n-1} are coprime (as 3 and5 are coprime), we can use the property that if a + b divides c, and a and b are coprime, then a + b divides c and a divides c -b*k for some k. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, since GCD(3^{n-1},5^{n-1})=1, then GCD(3^{n-1},5^{n-1})=1.\\n\\nTherefore, since 3^{n-1} +5^{n-1} divides 2*5^{n-1}, and GCD(3^{n-1} +5^{n-1},5^{n-1}) divides GCD(3^{n-1},5^{n-1})=1. Therefore, 3^{n-1} +5^{n-1} divides 2. But as before, 3^{n-1} +5^{n-1}=2 only when n=1. For n>=2, 3^{n-1} +5^{n-1} >=3 +5=8>2, so the only solution is n=1.\\n\\nTherefore, after multiple approaches, the only positive integer n is 1.
